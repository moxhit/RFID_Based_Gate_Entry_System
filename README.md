# RFID-Based Gate Entry System

This project implements an RFID-based gate entry system using an ESP8266 microcontroller and MFRC522 RFID reader. The system reads RFID cards, connects to a WiFi network, and communicates with a server over HTTPS to verify the card data. Based on the server's response, it controls LEDs and a buzzer to indicate the entry status.

## Introduction

The RFID-Based Gate Entry System is designed to provide secure access control using RFID technology. The system reads the RFID card data, sends it to a server for validation, and provides visual and auditory feedback based on the server's response. This project is ideal for implementing access control in various scenarios such as office entrances, restricted areas, and more.
